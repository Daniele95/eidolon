## How to import scene
Before loading scene for the first time you should go to Daniele/modelli folder from
unity file manager and build prefabs, without the option import materials.

## TODO
* Cutscene to go trough a wall
* Construct the main scene with xmind file
* (secondario) Object should not go inside walls when you grab it
* (secondario) Object should not be "grabbable" from behind a wall
